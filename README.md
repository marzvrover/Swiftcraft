# Swiftcraft

Swiftcraft is a swift implementation of the Minecraft Server. The goal of this project is to provide a fast resource efficient Minecraft server.
**This is an active WIP.** Currently in the first steps of implementing the Minecraft Protocol.
You should expect massive amounts of refactoring.

## Protocol

This server is built from the ground up implementing [Minecraft's Protocol.](https://wiki.vg/Protocol)

## Credits

I would like to give a huge shoutout to #mcdevs for their working in maintaining [Wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg).
Another shoutout goes to [Tnze](https://github.com/Tnze) for their work on [Tnze/go-mc](https://github.com/Tnze/go-mc) which helped me get low level things like VarInt and VarLong figured out.
